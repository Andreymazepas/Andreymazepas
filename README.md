## Hey there
I'm Andrey MazÃ©pas, a sofware engineer currently working with web development. For the last 5 years I've been focusing on front end technologies like React.js and Angular but nowadays I've been slowly shifting into the back end with Node, Kotlin and Ruby.

Although I'm only 25 years old, I grew up around old computers and gaming consoles, that made me appreciate more concepts like memory optimization, resource allocation and how techonology changed over the decades. Back then I started creating my first programs using BASIC interpreters and became more interested in computer science by learning about assembly and how old consoles ran their games.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and Ruby 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about retro technology stuff
